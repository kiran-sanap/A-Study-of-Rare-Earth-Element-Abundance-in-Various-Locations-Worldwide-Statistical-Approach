# A-Study-of-Rare-Earth-Element-Abundance-in-Various-Locations-Worldwide-Statistical-Approach
Problem Statement:

Rare Earth Elements (REEs) are critical for clean energy technologies, electronics, and strategic industries. Despite their importance, REE distributions vary significantly across geological settings and rock types. Traditional univariate analysis often fails to capture the complex, multivariate nature of REE geochemistry. This project addresses the need for a robust statistical framework to analyze REE abundance, variation, and relationships across multiple global locations.

Objectives:

a. To study the abundance and distribution of REEs across different geological locations and rock types

b. To identify geochemical patterns among Light and Heavy Rare Earth Elements (LREEs & HREEs)

c. To apply multivariate statistical techniques for classification and interpretation

d. To determine key elements influencing REE enrichment using regularized regression models

e. To assess statistically significant differences between rock groups using ANOVA and high-dimensional tests

Tools & Technologies:

Programming & Analysis: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, SciPy

Statistical Techniques: Descriptive statistics, Skewness & kurtosis analysis, Missing value imputation (Median), Log transformation, Hierarchical & K-Means clustering, Cluster profiling & heatmaps, Elastic Net regression, ANOVA & High-Dimensional Hotelling’s T²

Data Source:

The study uses published geochemical datasets from internationally recognized research sources:

a. Bayan Obo, China – World’s largest REE deposit

b. Belaya Zima, Russia – Multi-phase carbonatite complex

c. Fen Complex, Norway – Carbonatite and hydrothermal alteration system

Primary references include peer-reviewed journal articles on REE-rich carbonatite complexes.
